== Compiling ==

	make clean justTheCliques

== Usage ==

	./justTheCliques edge_list.txt       > cliques.txt

or, if you just want cliques with at least 10 nodes in them,

	./justTheCliques edge_list.txt 10       > cliques.txt

this should be a little faster.
The cliques themselves are printed to stdout (hence the redirection above). Various
summary stats are printed on stderr. So, if you didn't want the cliques but
did want to see the sizes of the cliques found, to
	./justTheCliques edge_list.txt       > /dev/null
