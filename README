justTheCliques:   Find maximal cliques, via the Bron Kerbosch algorithm, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bron%E2%80%93Kerbosch_algorithm

== Compiling ==

	make clean justTheCliques

== Usage ==


	./justTheCliques your_edge_list.txt        [--stringIDs]    > cliques.txt

or, if you just want cliques with at least 10 nodes in them,

	./justTheCliques your_edge_list.txt -k 10  [--stringIDs]    > cliques.txt

this should be a little faster. --stringIDs is to allow strings, not just integers
in the input - see below.

The cliques themselves are printed to stdout (hence the redirection above). Various
summary stats are printed on stderr. So, if you didn't want the cliques but
did want to see the sizes of the cliques found, to

	./justTheCliques edge_list.txt       > /dev/null

== Input file ==

Each line of the your_edge_list.txt represents an edge. The first two fields
(delimited by commas, pipes(|), spaces or tabs) are the names of the two
nodes that are connected. Directionality is ignored, and self-loops will be rejected.
Any other fields on the line are also ignored.

By default, the node names are integers (64-bit integers). But you can change
this with the --stringIDs option; note this will increase memory usage.
